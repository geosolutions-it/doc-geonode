:ref:`django_overview_index`
    This section introduces some basic concepts of DJango, the Python based web framework on top of which GeoNode has been developed.

    Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. Django emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components,
    rapid development, and the principle of *don't repeat yourself*. 
    Python is used throughout, even for settings, files, and data models. 

    Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.
