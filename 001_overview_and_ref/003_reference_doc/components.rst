In order to get started, letâ€™s look at the GeoNode interface and get a feel for how to navigate around it.

The GeoNode web interface is the primary method of interacting with GeoNode as a user. 
From this interface, one can view and modify existing spatial layers and maps, as well as find information on other GeoNode users.

Without being logged in, you are limited to read-only access of public layers.

#. Navigate to your GeoNode instance (online demo available `here <http://demo.geonode.org/>`_):

    *Welcome page*

    This page shows a variety of information about the current GeoNode instance. 
    At the top of the page is a toolbar showing quick links to view `layers <http://docs.geonode.org/en/latest/tutorials/users/layers/index.html#layers>`_, 
    `maps <http://docs.geonode.org/en/latest/tutorials/users/maps/index.html#maps>`_, documents (metadata), 
    `people <http://docs.geonode.org/en/latest/tutorials/users/accounts/index.html#accounts>`_, and a search field. Below this is a listing of recently updated layers, 
    including abstract, owner, rating, and download button (if available).

#. Click Explore button and choose Preview. Table data could be visualized as: Grid, Graph or Map.
