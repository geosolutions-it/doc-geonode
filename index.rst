GeoNode Training Documentation
==============================

Welcome to the GeoNode Training Documentation.

From here you can browse the documentation relative to the GeoNode Training Documentation.

.. hint:: An Ubuntu 18.04 Desktop 64-bit based Live ISO, containing the base packages and data for the execution of the workshop exercises, is available for download `here <https://goo.gl/ynKhuV>`_
    The Virtual Machine can also be launched through `VirtualBox <http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.2.14/>`_ binaries.
    
    .. note:: The ISO should be mounted ad Live CD and the Virtual Machine must enable EFI Boot options
    
    The users to be used with the Virtual Machine are:
    
    .. code-block:: yaml
    
        geo/geo # principal user whith suoders privileges
        /home/geo/ # is the location where you can find sources, binaries and training data
        /home/geo/my_geonode # is the location of a materialized `geonode-project <https://github.com/geosolutions-it/geonode-project.git>`_ Django template
        /home/geo/Envs/geonode/src/geonode # is the location of the GeoNode core sources
        postgres/postgres # system user for the management of the DBMS
        

The Documentation is divided in six main sections:

      individual negotiations for specific rights between copyright owne

      management employing standardized licenses for re-use cases where no

      is an agile, low-overhead and low-cost copyright-management regime,
