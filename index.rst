      Creative Commons (CC) is a non-profit organization devoted to
      expanding the range of creative works available for others to build
      upon legally and to share. The organization has released several
      copyright-licenses known as Creative Commons licenses free of charge
      to the public. These licenses allow creators to communicate which
      rights they reserve, and which rights they waive for the benefit of
      recipients or other creators. An easy-to-understand one-page
      explanation of rights, with associated visual symbols, explains the
      specifics of each Creative Commons license. Creative Commons licenses
      do not replace copyright, but are based upon it. They replace
      individual negotiations for specific rights between copyright owne
      (licensor) and licensee, which are necessary under an "all rights
      reserved" copyright management, with a "some rights reserved"
      management employing standardized licenses for re-use cases where no
      commercial compensation is sought by the copyright owner. The result
      is an agile, low-overhead and low-cost copyright-management regime,
      profiting both copyright owners and licensees.
